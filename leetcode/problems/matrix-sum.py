# given
#   - 2d Arrays aka Matrix
#   - score = 0
#
# Removed largest element from each row from the matrix
# add this number to score
# in case of ties remove anyone
# return final score
#
# brute force Approch
#   - MainTain a While Loop
#   - add a condition a check if matrix is empty or not in each iteration. [ becasue we not to keep processing until matrix is until. ]
#   - Loop through each list of matrix and extract max number in list removed numbers then remove that number from list until list is empty.
#   - keep appending score after each layer interation of the matrix.
#   - Thus, the overall complexity is O(m * nÂ²), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in nums.

# Optmized Apprroch
#   - Sort the nums before hand so you use pop instead that has lower time complexity.
#   - Thus, the overall complexity is O(n * m log m), which is much faster than the brute-force version.
